<h2>About</h2>
Bitwave is a personal project of mine that was developed initially as a result of not being able to find any decent
ssh interfaces that worked with Arch linux; requirements for me were quite versatile and I needed an application
that could fit as many compatabilities into it as possible. This is that application. Bitwave removes the hassle 
of manually setting up a fileserver completely and offers a smooth, streamlined installation and usage process.
